Character:...
YOU WAKE UP IN A- *COUGH* *ACK*
Sorry, I choked on my coffee. Anyways...
You wake up in what appears to be in some forest? Swamp?
I don't know, look around and find out.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
I'm sorry where and who is talking to me?

Character:...
Are you referring to me?

Main Character: (To be named by player)
Nooo the frog right in front of me.

*insert image of frog*

Character:...
That is a pretty neat frog.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
Right? Wait... we are side tracking. I mean you, the who knows what talking to me.

Character:...
Thats not important. If you're so desperate for a name, call me Enigma.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
An enigma?

Character: Enigma
No, Just Enigma. The E is capital.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
What does that even mean? How do I make the E capital if I am talking to you?

Character: Enigma
Look at the text and fix it.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
The what?

Character: Enigma
Forget it, It's too early for this kind of content.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
What are you talking about?

Character: Enigma
Don't worry about it. The important thing is that you know I am Enigma and we are in the middle of nowhere.
So the real question here is do you know who you are and where you are.

Main Character: (To be named by player)
That is a very good question... how about...

*Prompt player to enter name.*

Main Character: (Named)
.....

Character: Enigma
.....

Main Character: (Named)
Sure lets go with that.

Character: Enigma
Well, I guess that is a start. Now, do you know where you are?

Main Character: (Named)
Nope.

Character: Enigma
Well then. I guess you should start looking around.

Main Character: (Named)
You're not going to help?

Character: Enigma
Why should I? The way things are going, I am basically your conscience.

Main Character: (Named)
I can see you though.

*show image of Enigma as a question mark*
Character: Enigma
What do you mean?

Main Character: (Named)
You're right there.

Character: Enigma
You're delusional.

Main Character: (Named)
Whatever, Where should we go?

Character: Enigma
Don't ask me, I am just a figment of your imagination.

Main Character: (Named)
You said you were my conscience.

Character: Enigma
Same difference.

Main Character: (Named)
Well, I'll just walk a direction and see what happens.
